# Stroke_prediction
#### According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of global deaths.
#### This dataset is simple to understand, however it was a very small data set and must be handled carefully and models must be optimzied accordingly. Perhaps as more data is available, the models could train on more datasets to improve the accuracy and roc_auc score.
